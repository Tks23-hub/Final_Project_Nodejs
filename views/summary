in this project i built to tables
1.workers {
worker id so i can distinguish each worker i have in my store/factory.....
we also need the workers first and last name so i did
worker first name and worker last name s
}
2.work_time{
worker id so i can know connect to the first list so i can know which worker
and added 2 more colomuns to know the begining and ending the worker shift
start shift takes the time in gmt time and thats the begining of the shift
end shift also takes the time in gmt time and closes the shift to an end
and if you dont enter anything for the end shift so the worker still in the shift
and also added a shift id so the shift each time we start a shift with a worker
we will be able to close it even after many worker starting and ending shifts
}


-i created 2 js files for making crud for each table

-i created an ejs page named mainpage which is for adding useres and look at the list of all the workers

-i created an ejs page named enter-leave and this one containg 2 buttons one for starting the shift and the other is for ending each time you click
one of the buttons the js fetching the real time of gmt and send it to the table on the same shift id we have there

-i created an ejs page named shifts so we can see all the shifts we have and we also can see each worker shift by typing the worker id

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-why i choose id methond instead of regular ->

now i choose to use id's instead of names in fetching the shifts and clocking in or out because we might have alot of workers with the same first and last name
so i used id's to identify each worker we want
that what i saw before in factories when i worked they have so many workers that have the same first and last name so we used to clock into shifts only using our id's
