i faced some problems while typing this code

1-one of the main issues i have faced in this code that i was not able to delte the worker because i used there id in the second table
but i managed to connect them in a better way and fixed that problem so fast

2-the second one i faced so much small errors during typing this code so i went back to some of my js projects and classes in my first simister
 as a software enginer and used some of the codes that helps me finding errors in my code and fixing them in a better wat


i did face some other issues in the code but it wasnt big issues it only took minutes to be solved like getting the date and time for the shifts
and figuring out how im gonna add shifts for each worker .........

basicly the code took alot of time but after all it was a good outcome and less major errors that didnot make much time to be fixed


3- i changed from time to datetime in my sql so i can get the date and time also
